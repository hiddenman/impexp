"""
The back-end wrapper presents a unified and simple interface for
manipulating the native widget. It also installs event handlers so
that it can send the proper Anygui events (through the send function)
as a reaction to native events, and so that it can update the proxy
state (through the rawModify method) whenever the native widget is
modified by the user. The wrapper is responsible for creating and
destroying the native widget as needed. It should also destroy the
widget when explicitly told to do so through the destroy method.

The only methods that should be explicitly called by the Proxy are:

  update(state)
  getPrefs()
  prod()
  enableEvent(event)
  disableEvent(event)
  destroy()
