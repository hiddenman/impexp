"""
skelgui.py is an empty skeleton waiting for you to implement an
Anygui back-end.

You should probably read IRFC14 (nondist/irfc/irfc-0014.txt
in the CVS repository) before trying to implement an
Anygui backend. Specifically, you should understand the
terms "proxy", "wrapper", and "(native) widget" as
they're used in Anygui. The classes implemented in
a backend (and the classes in this file) are "wrappers"
around "native widgets".

To use this skeleton, simply copy it to a file in the
anygui/lib/backends directory called <yourbackend>gui.py,
and implement all of the methods and event handlers
described below. Depending on your particular backend, there
may be some opportunities to combine methods into mixin classes.

The fastest way to resolve any questions or ambiguities
about this file, is to look at one of the existing
back-end implementations in the anygui/lib/anygui/backends
directory. Failing that, post your question to
the Anygui development list (devel@anygui.org).

If you are implementing an Anygui backend, you should
be subscribed to the development list. See

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/anygui-devel

for subscription instructions.
